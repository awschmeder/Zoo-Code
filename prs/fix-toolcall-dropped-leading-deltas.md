Closes: #695

### Description

When a provider streams a tool call whose first delta(s) arrive *before* the tool-call `id` is known, those leading argument bytes are silently discarded by `NativeToolCallParser.processRawChunk`. This causes downstream "missing required parameter" errors even when the model supplied the data.

This PR fixes the issue by centralizing the tracking of streaming tool calls in `NativeToolCallParser`. The `rawChunkTracker` is now initialized on the first sight of a stream `index`, independent of whether an `id` is present. All `arguments` deltas are buffered until both `id` and `name` are known, ensuring no data loss during streaming reassembly.

### Test Procedure

1. Ran the newly added unit test in `src/core/assistant-message/__tests__/NativeToolCallParser.spec.ts` which verifies that leading argument bytes arriving before the `id` are correctly preserved and finalized.
2. Verified that existing provider tests in the same test file pass.

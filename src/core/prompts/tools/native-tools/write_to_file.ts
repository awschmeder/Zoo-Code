const WRITE_TO_FILE_DESCRIPTION = `Request to write content to a file. This tool is primarily used for creating new files or for scenarios where a complete rewrite of an existing file is intentionally required. If the file exists, it will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it will be created. This tool will automatically create any directories needed to write the file.

**Important:** This tool rewrites the entire file from the content you provide. For edits to an existing large file, prefer a surgical edit tool (e.g. apply_diff) instead -- it is faster and avoids re-emitting the whole file. Use write_to_file primarily for new file creation or an intentional full rewrite.

When using this tool, use it directly with the desired content. You do not need to display the content before using the tool. Provide the COMPLETE intended file content: partial updates or placeholders like '// rest of code unchanged' produce broken files and must not be used. Because the tool writes whatever content you supply, very large rewrites risk hitting the response output budget; when a file is too large to emit in full reliably, prefer a surgical edit tool instead.

When creating a new project, organize all new files within a dedicated project directory unless the user specifies otherwise. Structure the project logically, adhering to best practices for the specific type of project being created.

Example: Writing a configuration file
{ "path": "frontend-config.json", "content": "{\\n  \\"apiEndpoint\\": \\"https://api.example.com\\",\\n  \\"theme\\": {\\n    \\"primaryColor\\": \\"#007bff\\"\\n  }\\n}" }`

const PATH_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `The path of the file to write to (relative to the current workspace directory)`

const CONTENT_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `The content to write to the file. ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE intended content of the file, without any truncation or omissions. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified. Do NOT include line numbers in the content.`
